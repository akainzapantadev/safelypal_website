<h2 class="section-heading">Here we will discuss the 2 types of crypto wallet. </h2>

<h2 class="section-heading1">Types of Crypto Wallet</h2>

<h2 class="section-heading2">1. Hot Wallet or Software Wallet - A "hot" wallet is one where the wallet software has direct access to the private keys. If the private key is usable, attackers have access to it and can compromise it.
In the hot wallet scenario, a remote attacker can spend the entire amount of money in the wallet without anyone realizing that the service has been compromised. </h2>

<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Easy Access</p>
    <p>You don't have time to fuss with a USB connection if you do transactions frequently. You may manage your crypto assets around-the-clock and in any situation using mobile wallet apps.</p>
    <p>Low Cost</p>
    <p>Hot cryptocurrency wallets are either free to use or have little ongoing expenses.</p>
    <p>User-friendly</p>
    <p>Installation and use are simple. Many of them are connected to an exchange or have an exchange built-in, in addition to having a fairly straightforward user interface.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Prone to Theft</p>
    <p>Because the public and private keys are kept online, any objects kept in a hot wallet are open to assault.</p>
    <p>Third-party Dependent</p>
    <p>You cannot access your private keys in the majority of hot wallets offered by exchanges. Just a login and password are provided to access your account. You and the intermediary share responsibility for the security of the assets, but without the intermediary, no transactions may be completed. As a result, you never fully control your money.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 class="section-heading2">2. Cold Wallet or Hardware Wallet - The private key is not immediately accessible for a cold wallet (it is on a hardware key that is not placed into a computer, on a piece of paper, etc.). A computer cannot compromise a key that is not accessible to it, hence this rule does not apply. It is an electronic-yet-physical gadget made specifically for protecting cryptocurrency. Without ever being online, you can send funds from your crypto wallet by connecting it to your computer via USB. As a result, they are frequently applied to big sums of money.</h2>

<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Secure</p>
    <p>You don't give your private keys to anyone else. Since the wallet is not online, hackers cannot access it. Carrying it makes it more difficult to steal, so you shouldn't do that. You could even store it in a bank vault or a safe. In addition, you input your password on hardware rather than on a PC that is vulnerable to malware and hacking. The majority of hardware wallets use pin protection and encryption. Some of them even have a biometric authentication layer as an added security measure.</p>
    <p>Easy Recovery</p>
    <p>You must jot down a 12- to 24-word recovery phrase at the time of initial configuration. It is original and produced by the apparatus. You can replace your hardware wallet if it is stolen, lost, or destroyed, or you can import the recovery data into one or more software wallets to receive your assets right away.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>High Cost</p>
    <p>While many online cryptocurrency wallets are free or have modest fees, cold hardware wallets typically cost around $100.</p>
    <p>Limited</p>
    <p>They often accept fewer cryptocurrency than the majority of hot wallets. Because of this, cold wallets might not support the cryptocurrency you want if it isn't yet particularly well-known.</p>
    <p>Delay</p>
    <p>The access time to the cold wallet device will be longer even if the transaction itself takes the same amount of time. Additionally, it isn't portable and you generally won't use it in a public setting. It is therefore inappropriate for day traders and rapid trades.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 class="section-heading">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Before choosing a cryptocurrency wallet, you should be well-informed on all you need to know and confident in your decision. Investing in cryptocurrencies should be considered speculative, therefore your risk management plans should match the amount you invest. Less than 10% of the total available assets should typically be allocated to speculative investments, with the remaining 90% being held in long-term holdings of dividend-paying stocks with successful business strategies.</p>
