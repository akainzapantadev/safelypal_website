                    <p>The majority of people may not be aware that, twenty years ago, websites frequently displayed icons that read, "This site has been optimized for Internet Explorer."</p>
                    <p>A struggle was fought over who would control the portal to the early consumer internet, just like there is now between Web 2.0 monopolies and Web 3.0 communities: an open-source nonprofit or a closed-source global monopoly.</p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Everything You Need To Know About Web</h2>

                    <p>The pages or sites you see when you go online are known as the Web, formerly known as the World Wide Web. </p>
                    <p>The Web runs on a network of linked computers called the Internet, which also serves as a conduit for the transmission of data and emails.</p>
                    <p>Internet is the highway system that connects numerous cities. The Internet has been used and is still being utilized by all versions of the Web to link users to websites and one another. That quality never changes.</p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Difference Between Web 1.0, 2.0, And The Upcoming Web 3.0</h2>

                    <p>Given that these two Web incarnations are the ones that most users are most accustomed to, let's examine them more closely.</p> 
                    <p> The "old" Internet (Web 1.0) is no doubt well-known to long-time Internet users, and because Web 2.0 is now the de facto standard, everyone has used it in some capacity.</p> 
                    <p>Web 3.0 hasn't yet been fully implemented, however there are bits and pieces of it here and there. The Web 2.0 is a dynamic entity, as opposed to the static Web 1.0. </p>
                    <p>Then, we reintroduce Web 3.0 and see how it elevates the user experience.</p>

                    <p>The foundation of Web 3.0, often known as Web3, is composed of the fundamental concepts of decentralization, openness, and enhanced user usefulness. </p>
                    <p>Web 3.0 is the "read, write, execute Web," while Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "Participative Social Web," and so on.</p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Future of Crypto Wallet in Web 3.0</h2>


                    <p>The crypto wallet of a user will serve as a key to all of their domains, properties, NFTs, and other virtual assets. </p>
                    <p>They would have to wait until the key's term ended if they lost it before they could renew it. </p>
                    <p>However, a complete loss is unlikely to occur because everyone's online identities would be so closely tied to their wallets, and businesses are already working on ways to prevent such losses.</p>
                    <p>Identity won't change on its own; it will change in connection to ownership as well. </p>
                    <p>Domain ownership will change to permanent status. </p>
                    <p>Only a cryptocurrency wallet will make all of this possible.</p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>Given the potential of cryptocurrency wallets, the future of domain registration and digital identity will combine individual ownership with a focus on collective gain. </p>
                    <p>It will transform how we identify online.</p>


                    <p>The end effect of these modifications will be immutable identity evidence on the blockchain. </p>
                    <p>A user will own a property, whether it is a domain or an NFT, once they pay for it; no company may revoke or tamper with that ownership.</p>
